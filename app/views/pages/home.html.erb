  <p class="p1">About Us You</p>

  <p class="p1">This is the bit where we talk about ourselves.</p">

  <p class="p1"> This project and that big client.</p>

  <p class="p1">This award and that thing we won that’s now a doorstop yadda yadda yadda…</p>

  <p class="p1">This isn’t really our style though.</p>

  <p class="p1">This is because we’d rather listen to our clients, instead of talking at them.</p>

  <p class="p1">This is why our ideas never come off the shelf, or off the wall (unless you want them to).</p>

  <p class="p1">This is why we work with everyone from fashion labels to charities.</p>

  <p class="p1">This is attention to detail and time well spent.</p>

  <p class="p1">Oh, and this has never been (or ever will be) about us.</p>
